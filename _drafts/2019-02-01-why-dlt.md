# Introduction

According to the [Human Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Revolution_(human_origins)) theory (also called sometimes _Linguistic Revolution_), some tens-to-hundreds of thousands years ago we achieved rather suddenly (in evolutionary terms) our peculiar ability to imagine, abstract and symbolize. Together with that we also started being haunted by the curse of continuously confusing symbols with reality: we got both dreams and nightmares in the same deal,as two faces of the same coin.

On the bright side we achieved a higher freedom from the hardnesses of wild life and became able to imagine and realize the useful and the beautiful and, along the course of history, many **different** and **diverse** cultural forms were born, embedding and expressing human ideals of knowledge and beauty.

On the dark side we crafted, believed and made believe all sorts of ideologies to justify and reinforce **divisions**, egoistic craziness and pathological greed, self- and world-degradation as well the most abhorrent crimes against pretty much any species up to and including, of course, our own.

**Information Technology** and especially the Internet have completely unlashed our abilities by overcoming physical barriers and by globalizing content, knowledge and communication: we have and can provide access to pretty much anything, be it the useful, beautiful and diverse or the destructive and divisive.

**Augmented Cognition** technologies such as Machine Learning allow us to find patterns in vast amounts of data and to obtain valuable and actionable analytical insight much beyond our physiological analytical abilities; we can then leverage such insights to direct our efforts towards our goals, whatever they might be, or even towards full machine autonomy, including decision processes, of tasks previously thought to be extremely hard for computers to carry out (let alone better than humans) such as driving.

We have been strongly inter-dependent on our core and extended family (our _tribe_) for our own survival and, as a consequence, for our physical and psychological health and well-being; but **our tribe is nowadays the global human society**, unified by information technology on one hand and, on the other hand, both wonderfully diverse and worryingly divided.

Due to their neutrality, the same global communication and augmented cognition capabilities that empower collaboration on science, art, culture, fair exchange and functional competition can serve just as well power-grabbing, divide-and-conquer, dictatorial, manipulative, abusive and trust-crashing agendas. In addition,the richness of cultural diversity also encompasses differences in values and worldviews that can create **distrust**: lot of dilemmas in today's progressively unifying world are connected to the tension between the need to overcome (or at least work around) divisions and distrust while at the same time avoiding cultural death both in the form of cultural levelling and its reaction, that is cultural insularity and mummification.

> Given that we are not going to see divisions and distrust magically disappear anytime soon, the question now becomes: how can people really cooperate while being separated by **trust barriers**?

We're not plagued by **lack of trust** alone though, but also by **blind trust** and, rather paradoxically, we strongly rely on the latter kind in order to overcome the former: we put a decisive amount of _faith_ in specific individuals and organizations acting as black-box **trusted intermediaries** and **authorities** to reach pretty much any formal agreement in our lives: from buying food and achieving legal entitlements to voting and accessing medical care.

# Present-day real-life trust relationships

When you were born, your parents' entitlement to both the local medical system and the administrative authority granted you respectively a healthy birth and administrative records as resident and/or citizen of one or more countries, which in turn granted you too the medical and administrative accesses that you'll need throughout your entire life. From this point on **you are a registered member of the global human society** and you'll be able to obtain documents acting as _proofs_ of that in the form of IDs (for national affairs) and passports (for international ones).

Your parents _trust_ in the medical and administrative authorities is what granted you access to human society but we'll move from this point on, where you already have both _identity_ and _medical_ credentials.

Let's have a look look at some real-life examples of **present-day trust relationships**; I'm going to try and cut them separate according to the domain but I'm also going to note that they are really strongly interconnected and inter-dependent.

## An Economic and Financial System of Trust

This is perhaps the most apparent system of trust of all: from the moment you receive a money gift and put it into a deposit, often early in your life, you trust your bank(s) and the intermediaries in the banking and payment circuits (PayPal, credit card companies, the other parties' banks etc.) to:

- Correctly receive your salary and generally incoming payments;
- Identify your identity both when carrying out operations online and in person at branches;
- Carry out transactions of various complexity on your behalf, either on demand or automatically;
- Correctly, safely and privately **notarize** all of the above, including historical data and current positions;
- Provide information and support to resolve potential disputes.

They must be worthy of such trust because you pay them fees and, most of all, failure in doing so can cause a severe loss of time and money in disputes in the best case, or in the worst case a serious economic havoc in your life with all the associated negative, potentially far reaching consequenses.

In turn such institutions must also trust _super-authorities_ such as national banks, the administrative and legal systems and information about consumer trustworthiness and credit history protected, governed and shared by further super-authorities above all interests.

## A Supply Chain System of Trust

If you want to survive you'll need to trust the food supply chain and, to achieve anything at all, you'll also need to trust the energy and telecommunications supply-chains.

When you buy food at the supermarket, apart from resorting to the [Economic and Financial System of Trust](), you also trust recursively backward a long chain of relationships:

- You _trust_ the supermarket to provide fresh and safe produce;
- The supermarket _trusts_ the delivery provider to respect the contractual terms of transport for food safety and quality and pay the agreed price;
- The delivery provider _trusts_ the storage provider to respect the contractual terms of storage for food safety and quality and pay the agreed price;
- The storage-delivery chain can be very long depending on the product origin but at the source there is the producer which the gross buyer _trusts_ about agreed food parameters (health-related or other, for example think of organic or origin certifications) and pays the agreed price.
- Along the whole chain food health institutions carry out food safety checks and requires valid entitlements that can vary from country to country.

All of these parties and authorities will use internal, separate information systems for their part of the business only, there is often no end-to-end tracking (or if there is, it is governed by a single big interest group, such as the food store, and is only partially checked) and verifying that contractual terms are respected can be very tricky and costly as well as a source of hard disputes. Finally, worst of all, the consumer has little or no access to such knowledge and trusts the little information present on the label as well as the supermarket's reputation more or less blindly.

The main triggers for serious dispute and costly in-depth verification are very grave and serious events such as reported food poisoning cases.

As for the energy supply chain, there are typically 4 components: the generator, the carrier or transmitter, the distributor and the retailer that doesn't own any infrastructure but just manages and bills customers for the final energy delivery. When you buy energy for your house you usually deal with the retailer only; you _trust_ it about service quality and try to achieve reasonable prices by _trusting_ a hopefully honest and competitive service market economy.

## An Administrative and Identity System of Trust

Supposing you want (or need) to move to another country, it will be your responsibility to:

- Check the legal requirements in all of your citizenship (at least the one of which you'll be using the "sponsorship", i.e. passort), source and destination countries for travelling and staying; for that you'll need to trust the authenticity and correcteness of Internet sources, if you're lucky enough that they have been made available in languages you can understand, or hope to be able to reach telefonically such offices in their working hours (and again trust some directory containing that information) or go there in person and hope that the officers will be well-meaning, will know the business and will be able to communicate it to you.
- Obtain all of the required documents through many errands and visits to different institutional offices; for instance: buy photographs, buy pre-paid stamps for public documents, request the birth certificate at the municipality, request the (hopefully empty) criminal history at the country's legal offices (you might need to ask the embassy if you're not physically there), obtain or renew a passport (again, you might need the embassy), potentially obtain a visa for entering the destination country (most probably you'll need to contact the embassy in your current country). All of these steps include of course trust in the processes and the people carrying them out, as well as in the autenticity and integrity of input (e.g. ID) and output (e.g. passport) documents. Of course you'll also need to pay for many, if not all, of these transactions and you'll need to rely on the [Economic and Financial System of Trust]() for that.
- Find a place to stay in the destination country, arrange and sign a contract remotely (again, long chain of more or less deserved trust include intermediaries such as hotel or estate agencies and websites) or trust a local connection to help.
- Buy tickets (possibly trusting intermediaries such as agencies or best-price websites to do so), health and travel insurances and whatever you think I'll and I'm allowed to carry there by relying on the [Supply Chain System of Trust]().
- Once there, you'll need to start your trust relationship with a different legal system, easily in a (more or less) different language, certainly in a different culture; notwithstanding all of these barriers you'll need to do that through more or less well-defined, reliable, available and well-meaning processes and officers e.g. in the Municipality, the Population/Immigration national authority, a different health system and you'll need to do so regularly. Of course you'll also need to trust all of these foreign authorities and intermediaries to keep all records and historical data private, safe and whole.

Depending on how much the destination country wants to make your life miserable and your stay hard (or rather, in virtuous cases, pleasant and easy), you might need to obtain every year tens of documents, declarations and certifications, each of them resulting from potentially long processes you have to carry out, mostly in person, on the basis of trust relationships with public and/or private, domestic and/or foreign organizations and intermediaries.

## A Medical Sytem of Trust

In the unfortunate case you're ill, you'll need to:

- Take your (possibly national) card emitted by the insurance (an intermediary) and get in touch with a clinic (intermediary).
- The clinic and you will agree on an appointment either with a generic doctor (assigned by the insurance, another intermediary) or a specialist (assigned by the clinic on a case-by-case basis).
- You'll go to the clinic on the agreed date and time (let's assume by feet to avoid further complicating things), show your insurance card to be identified by the clinic reception person (an intermediary) and then the doctor, acting as an intermediary with the clinic, retrieves my historical health records from the clinic's database; they both trust you because you have your insurance card and it looks like yours (they might check that it matches your ID if they have doubts about your ownership of it) and the insurance database says it's a valid one.
- You then trust the doctor being a real doctor and the right doctor mostly because of being allowed working there, having been assigned to you by the clinic and possibly having had a look at his (unverified) credentials published on the clinic's website.
- You also trust him/her to reliably store your new clinical records and of course you trust the clinic to keep them private, safe and whole together with the historical ones.
- You might get prescriptions that the doctor might write down on a piece of paper with a specific layout and appearance or transmit directly to the drugstore (if the systems allow that); you then go to the drugstore and show them either your card or your paper prescription: in the latter case they trust the paper more or less blindly based on experience recognising such forms and hand signatures but in the former case they check with the clinic DB and the insurance DB resp. (or some other intermediary collecting data from both) what the prescription prescribes and if and how much of the cost is covered by your insurance.
- You'll need to pay and trust (accompanied perhaps by some checks) is put in the authenticity of your cash as well as hope that I got it legally (as it is untraceable); alternatively you trust my bank to authorize your credit card Company (again, intermediaries belonging to the Economic and Financial System of Trust seen above) to timely and correctly charge your account.

If you choose move to another clinic, you'll be likely responsible for the following actions:

- Notifying the insurance or even obtain authorization for it, most likely at least telephonically if not with a visit;
- Closing the previous position at the clinic, most likely in person at your branch;
- Opening the new position at the new clinic, most likely in person at your new branch;
- Hope there is a process in place or at least legal obligation (of course you also need to trust the executive and legal systems of the Country where you are located) to transfer your medical history to the new clinic, because the old clinic has "only" reputation interest in letting you go and, depending on management, economic situation and many other factors, it might weight this against the more concrete and immediate economic interest of jeopardizing your move.
- Else you'll have to slowly, patiently and progressively reconstruct your health history at the new clinic with the help of their doctors as proxies, based upon printouts of partial information such as exams and prescriptions that hopefully you kept stacked somewhere and in good enough conditions.

Receiving the services of multiple health providers, if your illness is serious and requires specialized treatment, is going to be an adventure in both faith and bureaocracy precisely at a time when you can least bear that.

## A Government System of Trust

Although notable exceptions exist (see for example [Switzerland's direct democracy system](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/07/switzerland-direct-democracy-explained/)), most democratic countries adopt _representative democracy_, that is we mostly decide on local and national government matters by voting every few years for a small number of politicians based on programs and perceived closeness in worldview, _trusting_ that they told the truth about themselves in the campain _and_ that they'll act in our interests and according to those shared values and ideas. We might be occasionally called to directly vote on select, pre-crafted, questions with binary yes/no answers through _referendums_.

We don't have to research a lot to see that both representative politics and referendums are falling short of actually improving on very important matters in a lot of countries and why this is happening is a complex matter probably due to a combination of several factors. I am no political scientist but some possible reasons I can think of are:

- Direct democracy just isn't allowed in most countries;
- Widespread education on civic matters is insufficient;
- Politics is often a full-time career and a rewarding one in terms of power and money, which means that all sorts of people, including some not too interested in the common good, wish to get a slice;
- Transparency about representatives' individual votes, when available, is often not voter-friendly;
- Even when trust infringement is ascertained, there's no way to retract one's vote for a representative until the next elections cycle (which may be years away);
- Huge and powerful groups of interests can target a limited number of representatives to significantly influence legislation and governement processes in their favor;
- Election processes are costly, time-expensive and mediated by more or less honest and more or less well-meaning officers;
- At the same time they don't happen often enough to hold representatives accountable and are not fine-grained enough (for example there's no way to have different representatives on different matters);
- There is not enough accountability on what has been said and promised by representatives and they tend to switch positions based on what seems to assure their political survival, rather than the voters' correct representation;
- Such a system overall tends to favor the dishonest rather than the honest representative, with the side-effect of continuously lowering the quality of the political offering.
- To make matters worse, recently intelligence abilities combined with social platforms' profiling and automatic influencing systems were able to significantly sway public opinions (and votes) towards the interest specific people or groups that could afford employing such systems.

Non-public governance systems, such of private companies, suffer from even worse lack of transparency of both processes and managers appointments (even though there is at least a market-driven form of accountability based on business profitability and sustainability).

# The common denominator of Trust

All the intermediaries and the autorities in these systems of trust have in common certain well-defined elements:

- They provide _multi-party procedures_ that can be initiated by specific _interactions_ and/or _operations_ and carry out further operations and govern futher interactions (such as _exchanges_ or _transactions_ or _voting sessions_) until completion;
- They _authenticate_ all interactions by checking they are indeed requested by a party entitled and willing to start them;
- They _validate_ the inputs to those transactions and the correct execution of the procedures;
- They store an _updated position_ as well as an _immutable history_ of transactions that have been carried out in a _registry_ or _ledger_ to provide _accountability_ and _non-repudiability_;
- They take measures to protect such a ledger from tampering attempts and attacks of several kinds;
- They allow easily querying the ledger when it is necessary to do so (e.g. for dispute resolution or analysis based on historical data);
- If the information embedded in such transactions is confidential, they take measures to also provide _confidentiality_ guarantees;
- If the transactions require legal identification of the parties, they take care of verifying that they are (or represent) who they claim to be (or represent).

If you will, every intermediary and authority provides some form of _notary_ service in pretty traditional "black box" terms: they carry out the above functions by themselves and on their premises; we more or less blindly trust them to do so correctly and reliably only by virtue of their legal stamp of approval to provide such services (and possibly their perceived reputation).

There are several serious **trust-related cracks** in this "black box" approach though:

1. The ledgers being centralized at specific physical or data centers means that they are protected by traditional _fortress_ approaches and, given enough incentive to do so, a breach into a fortress can always be found.
2. The responsibility and costs of protecting high amounts of highly sensitive data can be simply overwhelming, leading to risky compromises and/or to excessive fees.
3. Even though most of the procedures could arguably be automated, they are often not and this leads to inefficiencies and user frustration.
4. Both the automatic and manual parts of the procedure might be sensitive to not-so-well-meaning human discretionality, errors, tampering and counterfaiting due to potential lack of adequate checks and reviews; but the worst thing is that we really have no way of knowing for sure.
5. The organization (or even just someone with the right access in it) might abuse its power position by e.g. illicitly monetizing on the data it holds, restricting access and portability to legitimate data owners, implement data and user lock-ins.
6. We need to trust several many intermediaries and authorities operating as just described, even for our most basic needs.
7. Ledgers owned by different organizations or divisions might be totally different and very costly to interoperate.
8. Different organizations don't necessarily trust each other and might have (or perceive having) little incentive in cooperating.
9. Scalability can be a serious issue for any centralized architecture if the user base either grows beyond certain magnitudes and/or grows too fast and/or just spreads too fast.

# How Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) can help with trust and relationships in a fragmented and decentralized world

I think that **our current golden standard of trust is the scientific method** and its outcomes and byproducts (such as scientific theories and technology) because of its measurability, openness and reproducibility requirements; even though it is a relatively expensive standard, once its results are peer-reviewed and confirmed, they are of proven and public utility until a better model is found. For this reason I think science and technology are ideally positioned to be the _root_ or _source_ of our _chain of trust_.

> **Distributed ledgers** are technological platforms of _programmable ("smart") notarization services_ that embed trust through strong cryptography, resilience through distributed and replicated storage and computation and integrity through distributed wide-scale consensus. They are **the unbreakable, uncorruptible, unstoppable, transparent, efficient, always available and general-purpose validating notary**.

Different platforms vary in characteristics and capabilities but the techniques and strategies they collectively offer can potentially solve _all_ of the above issues, in order:

1. They are essentially **peer-to-peer** (P2P) architectures: no single node holds exclusively (or in full) the whole ledger that is instead _distributed_ and _replicated_ across the whole network;
2. Data availability is guaranteed by **replication** while its protection is provided by **strong cryptographic techniques** that can implement strong authenticity, integrity/immutability and, if needed, confidentiality properties or even [Zero-Knowledge proofs of correctness]();
3. The ledger evolution is governed by **Smart Contracts**, i.e. _programs_ that can implement any type of procedure, agreement or transaction, can interact with other contracts (or even spawn new ones) and can be fully automatic (to the extent of not requiring human interaction);
4. Smart contract codes that implement procedures and interactions to achieve agreements are _public_ to the circle of its users and _agreed upon_ before activation; their inputs, executions and outputs are checked by all **validator nodes** against the ledger that acts as a single source of truth; finally they all cryptographically "sealed" back into the ledger itself through a fault-tolerand and tamper-proof (if required) **consensus protocol**;
5. A tamper-proof consensum means that **no minority in the system can disrupt or influence it** by bending the rules;
6. Every stakeholder is integral part of the system by participating with one or more nodes and so the system is completely **disintermediated**;
7. The distributed ledger is **fully general** and interoperability of different applications inside of it is straightforward;
8. The system is held together by cooperation, potentially through a **system of economic incentives for validating nodes**;
9. Due to the total disintermediation, the **computational load** for private contracts execution, validation and sealing can be **limited to the parties directly involved** (plus optionally any additional validating parties added to reinforce the consensus).

With this novel tool at our disposal let's now re-imagine the real-life systems of trust we discussed previously.

# Real-life Systems of Trust, now with DLT

# History and the DLT landscape

Arguably the first distributed ledger system appeared in 2009 with the publication of ["Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), a white paper published and signed by a still anonymous individual or collective under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto.

**Bitcoin** is still probably the the most famous and recognised single-purpose, public distributed ledger and it is built upon a _blockchain_ structure; the brilliant idea of Bitcoin's author(s) lies not so much in novel discoveries but rather in its original and organic way of integrating previous research results with economic incentives into a fully functional concept of distributed and disintermediated digital currency.

As in all public ledgers, Bitcoin users don't need to be authenticated into the system but can join and leave as they please: the only requirement is using a standard-compliant address. For this reason Bitcoin and other public ledgers need to be resilient against _identity forgery_ (AKA _Sybil_) attacks, where a minority of nodes tricks the system into considering it a majority through massive address forgery.
