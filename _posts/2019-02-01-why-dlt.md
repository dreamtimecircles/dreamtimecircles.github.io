![Humans](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-leonardo-da-vinci175411.jpg)

According to the [Human Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Revolution_(human_origins)) theory (sometimes called _Linguistic Revolution_), some tens-to-hundreds of thousands years ago our species achieved rather suddenly (in evolutionary terms) the peculiar ability to imagine, abstract and symbolize; unfortunately, inseparably from that, we also started being haunted by such abilities' power and experienced the curse of confusing and conflating abstractions with reality. On one hand **cultural diversity** thrived but on the other hand harmful and **divisive ideologies** did too.

**Information Technology** and especially _the Internet_ have completely unleashed such abilities by overcoming physical barriers and by globalizing content, knowledge and communication.

**Augmented Cognition** technologies such as _Machine Learning_ allow us to find patterns in vast amounts of data and to obtain valuable and actionable analytical insight much beyond our physiological analytical abilities; we can then leverage such insights to direct our efforts towards our goals, whatever they might be, or even towards full machine autonomy including the decision processes themselves: tasks previously thought to be improbable for machines to ever carry out better than people (or at all), such as driving, are now close to be fully automated.

We have been strongly inter-dependent on our core and extended family (our _tribe_) for our own survival and, as a consequence, for our physical and psychological health and well-being; our super-tribe is now the _interconnected, global human society_ which is both admirably diverse and worryingly divided.

Furthermore, the same global communication and augmented cognition capabilities that empower collaboration on science, art, culture, fair exchange and functional competition can serve just as well power-grabbing, divide-and-conquer, dictatorial, manipulative, abusive and trust-crashing agendas.

The richness of cultural diversity also encompasses differences in values and worldviews, as well as communication barriers and misunderstanding risks, that can increase **distrust**: serious dilemmas in today's progressively unifying world are connected to the tension between the need to collaborate in the presence of divisions and distrust while at the same time avoiding cultural death both in the form of cultural flattening and of its reaction, cultural insularity and mummification.

> Given that we are not going to see divisions and distrust magically disappear anytime soon, the question now becomes: how can people and organisations effectively cooperate while being separated by **trust barriers**?

We're not plagued by **lack of trust** alone though, but also by **blind trust** and, rather paradoxically, we strongly rely on the latter kind to overcome the former: we put a decisive amount of _faith_ in trusted intermediaries and authorities acting as black boxes to reach pretty much any formal agreement in our lives: from buying food and achieving legal entitlements to voting and accessing medical care.

# Present-day, Real-life Trust Relationships

When we were born, our parents' entitlement to both the local medical system and the administrative authority granted us respectively a healthy birth and administrative records as resident and/or citizen of _countries_, which in turn granted us too the medical and administrative accesses, as well as the legal protection, on which we build our entire lives. At that point **we became registered members of the global human society** and we can prove that by exhibiting IDs (for national affairs) and passports (for international ones).

Our parents' _entitlement_ and _trust_ in the medical, administrative, government and legal authorities (as well as their legal obligation to do so) is what granted us access to human society but I'll simplify and consider these credentials as a given and as our starting point.

Let's have a look look at some real-life examples of **present-day trust relationships**: I'm going to try and cut them separate according to the domain but I'm also going to point out that they are strongly interconnected and inter-dependent; later on we'll re-imagine all such cases with the support of distributed ledgers.

## An Economic and Financial System of Trust

![Economic Trust](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-dollars135472.jpg)

From the moment you receive a money gift and put it into a deposit, often early in your life, you trust your **bank**(s) and the intermediaries in the banking and payment circuits (PayPal, credit card companies, the other parties' banks etc.) to:

- Correctly receive your salary and generally incoming payments;
- Verify your identity both when carrying out operations online and in person at branches;
- Carry out transactions of various complexity on your behalf, either on demand or automatically;
- Correctly, safely and privately **notarize** all of the above, including historical data and current positions;
- Provide information and support to resolve potential disputes.

You pay them fees for them to afford being worthy of such trust (and they keep most profits from safely investing your money) because failure to keep your wealth balance correct and your money well-managed can cause serious havoc in your life.

In turn such institutions must also trust _super-authorities_ such as national banks, the administrative and legal systems and information about consumer trustworthiness and credit history that are protected, governed and shared by further super-authorities.

## A Supply Chain System of Trust

![Supply Ships](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-supply-ships138287.jpg)

If you want to survive you'll need to trust the food **supply chain** and, to accomplish anything at all, you'll also need to trust the energy and telecommunications supply-chains.

When you buy food at the supermarket, apart from relying on the Economic and Financial System of Trust, you also trust recursively backward a long chain of supply relationships:

- You trust the supermarket to provide fresh and safe produce;
- The supermarket trusts the delivery provider to respect the contractual terms of transport for food safety and quality and pay the agreed price;
- The delivery provider trusts the storage provider to respect the contractual terms of storage for food safety and quality and pay the agreed price;
- The storage-delivery chain can be very long but at the source there is the producer which the wholesaler trusts about agreed food parameters (health-related or other, for example think of organic or origin certifications) and pays the agreed price.
- Along the whole process, health institutions carry out food safety checks and require valid entitlements.

All of these parties and authorities will use internal, separate information systems for their part of the business only, there will be often no end-to-end tracking (or it might governed by a single big interest group, such as the food store, and only partially checked) and verifying that contractual terms are respected can be very tricky and costly as well as a source of hard disputes. Finally, worst of all, the consumer has little or no access to such knowledge and trusts more or less blindly the little information present on the label as well as the supermarket's reputation.

The triggers for serious disputes and costly in-depth checks are grave events such as food poisoning cases.

As for the **energy supply chain**, there are typically 4 components: the _generator_, the _carrier_ (or transmitter), the _distributor_ and the _retailer_; the latter does not own any infrastructure but just manages and bills customers for the final energy delivery. When you buy energy for your house you exclusively deal with the retailer that usually charges big fees (could be even 100%).

## An Administrative and Identity System of Trust

![Bureaucracy](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-pile-of-paper117595.jpg)

Supposing you want (or need) to **move to another country**, it will be your responsibility to:

- Check the legal requirements in your citizenship countries (or at least the one of which you'll be using the "sponsorship", i.e. the passport) as well as current and destination countries for travelling and staying; for that you'll need to trust the authenticity and correctness of Internet sources, if you're lucky enough that they are in languages you can understand, or hope to be able to reach by telephone such offices in their working hours (and again trust some directory containing that information) or go there and hope that the officers will be well-meaning, will know their business and will be able to communicate it correctly.
- Obtain all of the required documents through many errands and visits to different institutional offices; for instance: buy photographs, buy pre-paid stamps for public documents, request the birth certificate at the municipality, request the criminal history at the country's legal offices (you might need to ask the embassy if you're not physically there), obtain or renew a passport (again, you might need the embassy), potentially obtain a visa for entering the destination country (most probably you'll need to contact the embassy in your current country). All of these steps include of course trust in the processes and the people carrying them out, as well as in the authenticity and integrity of input (e.g. ID and various forms) and output (e.g. passport) documents. Of course you'll also need to pay for many, if not all, of these transactions and you'll need to rely on the Economic and Financial System of Trust for that.
- Find a place to stay in the destination country, arrange and sign a contract remotely (again, long chain of more or less deserved trust include intermediaries such as hotel or estate agencies and websites) or trust a local connection to help and sponsor you (possibly your employer).
- Buy tickets (possibly trusting intermediaries such as agencies or best-price websites to do so), health and travel insurances (and whatever you think you'll need) by relying on the Supply Chain System of Trust.
- Once there, you'll need to start your trust relationship with a different legal system, easily in a different language, certainly in a different culture; all of these barriers notwithstanding you'll need to do that through more or less well-defined, reliable, available and well-meaning processes and officers e.g. in the Municipality, the Population/Immigration national authority, in a different health system and you'll need to do so regularly. Of course you'll also need to trust all of these foreign authorities and intermediaries to keep all records and historical data private, safe and whole.

I won't even add work-related matters.

Depending on how much the destination country wants to make your life miserable and your stay hard (or rather, in virtuous cases, pleasant and easy), you might need to obtain every year tens of documents, declarations and certifications, each of them resulting from potentially long processes you have to carry out, mostly in person, on the basis of trust relationships with public and/or private, domestic and/or foreign organizations and intermediaries.

Welcome to the unpleasant status of being subject to multiple bureaucracies.

## A Medical System of Trust

![Doctor](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-doctor-pointing-to-x-ray-picture---chest-pa-radiography235658.jpg)

In the unfortunate case you're ill, you'll need to:

- Take your (possibly national) card emitted by the insurance (an intermediary) and get in touch with a clinic (intermediary).
- You will agree with the clinic on an appointment either with a generic doctor (assigned by the insurance, another intermediary) or a specialist (assigned by the clinic on a case-by-case basis).
- You'll go to the clinic on the agreed date and time (let's assume by feet, just to avoid further complicating things), show your insurance card to be identified by the receptionist (a trusted intermediary) and then the doctor, acting as a trusted intermediary with the clinic, will retrieve your historical health records from the clinic's database; they'll both trust you because you have your insurance card and it looks like yours (they might check that it matches your ID if they have doubts about that) plus the insurance database says it's a valid one.
- You'll then trust the doctor being a real doctor and the right doctor mostly because of being allowed working there, having been assigned to you by the clinic and possibly having had a look at his (unverified) credentials published on the clinic's website.
- You'll also trust her to reliably store your new clinical records and of course you trust the clinic to keep them private, safe and whole together with the historical ones.
- You might get prescriptions that the doctor will write down on a piece of paper with a specific layout and appearance or transmit directly to the drugstore (if the systems allow that); you'll then go to the drugstore and show them either your card or your paper prescription: in the latter case they'll trust the paper more or less blindly (based on experience recognising such forms and hand signatures) but in the former case they check with the clinic DB and the insurance DB respectively (or some other intermediary collecting data from both) what the prescription prescribes and if and how much of the cost is covered by your insurance.
- You'll need to pay and the cashier will trust (and perhaps check) the authenticity of your cash as well as hope that you got it legally, as it is untraceable; alternatively you'll trust your bank to authorize your credit card company (again, intermediaries belonging to the Economic and Financial System of Trust seen above) to correctly charge your account.

If you choose move to another clinic, you'll likely need to:

- Notifying the insurance or even obtain authorization for it, most likely at least by telephone if not with a personal visit;
- Closing the previous position at the clinic, most likely in person at your branch;
- Opening the new position at the new clinic, most likely in person at your new branch;
- Hope there is a process in place or at least a legal obligation (of course you also need to trust the executive and legal systems of the country where you are located) to transfer your medical history to the new clinic, because the old clinic has "only" reputation interest in letting you go and, depending on management, economic situation and many other factors, it might weight this against the more concrete and immediate economic interest of jeopardizing your move.
- Else you'll have to slowly, patiently and progressively reconstruct your health history at the new clinic with the help of their doctors as proxies, based upon print-outs of partial information such as exams and prescriptions that hopefully you stacked somewhere and kept in good enough conditions.

Receiving the services of multiple health providers, if your illness is serious and requires specialized treatment, is going to be an adventure in both faith and bureaucracy precisely at a time when you can least bear it.

## A Government System of Trust

![Parliament](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-parliament150497.jpg)

Although notable exceptions exist (see for example [Switzerland's direct democracy system](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/07/switzerland-direct-democracy-explained/)), most democratic countries adopt **representative democracy**, that is we mostly decide on local and national government matters by voting every few years for a small number of politicians based on programs and perceived closeness in worldview, _trusting_ that they told the truth about themselves during the campaign _and_ that they'll act in our interests and according to those shared values and ideas. We might be occasionally called to directly vote on select, pre-crafted, questions with binary yes/no answers through _referendums_.

We don't have to research a lot to see that both representative politics and referendums are falling short of actually improving on very important matters in a lot of countries and the reason why this is happening is quite a complex matter. I am no political scientist but some possible reasons I can think of are:

- Direct democracy just isn't allowed in most countries;
- Widespread education on civic matters is insufficient (this and the previous fact combined unfortunately create a vicious loop);
- Politics is often a full-time career and a rewarding one in terms of power and money, which means that all sorts of people, including some not too interested in the common good, wish to get a slice;
- Transparency about representatives' individual votes, when available, is often not voter-friendly;
- Even when trust infringement is ascertained, there's no way to retract one's vote for a representative until the next elections cycle (which may be years away);
- Huge and powerful groups of interests can target a limited number of representatives to significantly influence legislation and government processes in their favor;
- Election processes are costly, time-expensive and mediated by more or less honest and more or less well-meaning officers;
- At the same time they don't happen often enough to hold representatives accountable and are not fine-grained enough (for example there's no way to have different representatives on different matters);
- There is not enough accountability on what has been said and promised by representatives, which tend to switch positions based on what seems to assure their political survival, rather than the voters' correct representation;
- Due to the necessity of forming a stable government, many countries grant certain degrees of liberty to the political figure in charge of such a task, which can result in government alliances quite different from the ones declared during campaigns;
- Such a system overall tends to favor the dishonest rather than the honest representative, with the side-effect of continuously lowering the quality of the political offering;
- To make matters worse, recently intelligence abilities combined with social platforms' profiling and automatic influencing capabilities were able to significantly sway public opinion (and votes) towards the interest of specific groups.

Non-public governance systems, such of private companies, suffer from even worse lack of transparency of both processes and managers appointments, even though there is at least a market-driven form of accountability based on the business' profitability and sustainability.

## A Real-Estate System of Trust

![Old House](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-old-abandoned-estate-in-winter138268.jpg)

If you want to **buy a house**, you might need to follow a process that looks more or less like the following one:

- You'll most probably buy through an agent to help you and the seller through a long, complicated, expensive, bureaucratized process with many hoops that help only partially to avoid fraud;
- The agent will ask for several percent points of the sale value as a fee (this is very market-dependant but it could realistically be something like 3-8 percent and could be shared between buyer and seller);
- Once you've chosen your house, the agent will carry out the bureaucracy with the land register, which is essentially a big legal papers deposit, to retrieve the current information about the property (hopefully they did not lose the papers, which happens more often than you can think, in which case a much worse bureaucratic nightmare awaits);
- You'll then make an offering through the agent by attaching the property information, purchase terms (for example, within a specific date) and a cheque covering a significant percentage of the property value (might be 10%) as a guarantee deposit that you'll lose, should you change your mind;
- If/when the offering is accepted by the seller, at the end of a negotiation process, congratulations! You're now entering the real purchase process;
- You'll have already explored mortgage options, chosen a bank and opened an account there (not covering these additional headaches here) so you'll now provide the bank with many of documents about both yourself (both administrative ones and private ones, for example the work contract with your employer) and the property;
- The bank will analyze the documentation and then go physically inspecting the property, with the seller's permission, in order to ascertain if everything is in order both from a market and financial perspective (i.e. the value justifies the purchase and the mortgage) and from an administrative perspective (e.g. no illegal abuses on the premises); mind that this might take around 10 days to a month;
- Hopefully you'll obtain the mortgage authorization, else you might risk losing your deposit if you can't find another bank that will support your purchase;
- If everything looks OK, the offer is signed and the money will be available so the notarization process starts; the agent will most likely suggest a notary they trust and that you'll pay some percentage points of the property value (might be 4-10%) to check that everything is also 100% OK from a legal and contractual perspective (for example that there are not impeding debts or liabilities on the property and that the seller is really legally entitled to sell it) as well as to redact and notarize the purchase contract;
- You'll also pay the notary for the mortgage notarization, which might be something like 2% of the amount you'll be borrowing from the bank;
- Of course you'll need to add to all that conspicuous taxes, house insurance (which your bank might mandate) and mortgage insurance (which your bank might also mandate).

In all this you'll need to trust, more or less blindly, several institutional and private intermediaries such as the agent, the bank, the notary and the land register. The whole process might well take some months, several heart attacks and an additional total cost of 7%, up to maybe 20% of the property value, so you see why it is not recommended to buy a house if you don't intend to keep it for, say, 5 or more years.

Of course buying real estate is also an investment option, and usually a good one too, but it could be a much better one if it not were for the complications mentioned above.

This whole process is so risky, convoluted and expensive that in several cultures it has become a quasi-religious rite of passage to the stable and most mature stages of adult life.

# The Common Denominator of Trust

![Trust](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-agreement194107.jpg)

All the intermediaries and the authorities in these systems of trust **have in common certain well-defined elements**:

- They provide _multi-party procedures_ that can be initiated by specific _interactions_ and/or _operations_ and govern further interactions and carry out further operations (such as _exchanges_ or _transactions_ or _voting sessions_) until completion;
- They _authenticate_ all interactions by checking they are indeed requested by a party entitled and willing to start them;
- They _validate_ the inputs to those transactions and the correct execution of the procedures;
- In order to provide to provide _accountability_ and _non-repudiability_, they allow accessing a _current position_ and they store an _immutable history_ of transactions in a _registry_ or **ledger**;
- They take measures to protect such a ledger from tampering attempts and attacks of several kinds;
- They allow recovering current or historical information in certain circumstances (e.g. for dispute resolution or authorized analysis);
- If the information embedded in such transactions is confidential, they take measures to also provide _confidentiality_ guarantees;
- If the transactions require legal identification of the parties, they take care of verifying that they are (or represent) who they claim to be (or represent).

If you will, every intermediary and authority provides some form of _notary_ service in pretty traditional "black box" terms: they carry out the above functions by themselves and on their premises; we more or less blindly trust them to do so correctly and reliably only by virtue of their "legal stamp of approval" (and, when we have a choice, on their perceived reputation) to provide such services.

There are several serious **trust-related cracks** in this "black box" approach though:

1. The ledgers being centralized at specific physical or data centers means that they are protected by traditional _fortress_ approaches and, given enough incentive to do so, **a breach into a fortress can always be found**.
2. The **responsibility and costs of protecting high amounts of highly sensitive data** can be simply overwhelming, leading to risky compromises and/or to excessive fees.
3. Even though most of the procedures could arguably be automated, they are often not and this leads to **inefficiencies and user frustration**.
4. Both the automatic and manual parts of the procedure might be sensitive to not-so-well-meaning **human discretionality, errors, tampering and forge** due to potential lack of adequate checks and reviews; the worst thing anyway is that we have **no way of knowing for sure**, at least not before serious damage has already been done.
5. The organization (or even just someone with the right access in it) might **abuse its power position** by e.g. illicitly monetizing on the data it holds, restricting access and portability to legitimate data owners, implement all sorts of data and user lock-ins.
6. We need to trust **several intermediaries and authorities** operating as just described, even for our most basic needs.
7. Ledgers owned by different organizations or divisions might be totally different and very **costly to integrate**.
8. Different organizations don't necessarily trust each other and might have (or perceive having) **little incentive in cooperating**.
9. **Scalability** can be a serious issue for any centralized architecture if the user base either grows beyond certain magnitudes and/or grows too fast (and/or spreads too fast).

# Why Distributed Ledger Technology?

![Distributed Ledger](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-cloud-computing---iot---digital-cloud-technology241788.jpg)

I think that **our current golden standard of trust is the scientific method** because it produces results that are public, measurable, reproducible and so, once its results are peer-reviewed and confirmed, they are a solid foundation until a better model is found. For this reason I think science and technology are ideally positioned to be the _root_ of our _chain of trust_:

> **Distributed ledgers** are technological platforms of _automatic, programmable ("smart") notarization services_ that embed trust through strong cryptography, resilience through distributed and replicated storage as well as integrity through distributed wide-scale consensus. They are **the unbreakable, incorruptible, unstoppable, transparent, efficient, always available and general-purpose validating notary**.

For this reason, Distributed Ledger Technology is a potential holy grail for **securing digital relationships** as well as **pervasive and secure digital transformation**.

Different platforms vary in characteristics and capabilities but the techniques and strategies they collectively offer can potentially solve _all_ of the above issues, in order:

1. They are essentially **peer-to-peer** (P2P) architectures: no single node holds exclusively (or in full) the whole ledger that is instead _distributed_ and _replicated_ across the network; in addition, since the network secures data for everybody, everybody has an incentive to contribute to it;
2. Data availability is guaranteed by **replication** while its protection is provided by **strong cryptographic techniques** that can implement strong authenticity, integrity/immutability and, if needed, confidentiality properties or even [Zero-Knowledge proofs of correctness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof);
3. The ledger evolution is governed by **Smart Contracts**, i.e. _programs_ that can implement any type of procedure, agreement or transaction, can interact with other contracts (or spawn new ones) and can run fully autonomously when human interaction is not needed;
4. Smart contract codes that implement procedures and interactions to achieve agreements are _public_ to the circle of its users and _agreed upon_ before activation; their inputs, executions and outputs are checked by all **validator nodes** against the **ledger that acts as a single source of truth**; finally they all cryptographically "sealed" back into the ledger itself through a fault-tolerant and tamper-proof (if required) **consensus protocol**;
5. A tamper-proof consensus means that **no minority in the system can disrupt or influence it** by breaking or bending the rules;
6. Every stakeholder becomes integral part of the system by participating with nodes and so the system is completely **stripped of intermediaries**;
7. The distributed ledger is **fully general** and interoperability of different contracts is straightforward;
8. The system is held together by cooperation, potentially through a **system of economic incentives for validating nodes**;
9. Due to the total lack of intermediaries, the **computational load** for private contracts execution, validation and sealing can be **limited to the parties directly involved** (plus optionally any additional validating parties to reinforce the consensus).

With this novel tool at our disposal, let's now re-imagine the real-life systems of trust we discussed previously.

# Real-life Trust with Distributed Ledgers

I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in feeling that too big an amount of time in my life has been _wasted_ in dealing with **bureaucratic torture** resulting from fragmentation, lack of trust and most of all _lack of trust standards and mechanisms_ (when not because of people at many levels with not-so-good attitudes and intentions).

Having have become pretty jealous of my time, probably as a result of stepping into my forties, I feel like **eradicating bureaucracy and forcing paper-movers into more creative jobs** could be a really noble cause to give back time and freedom to people (as well as an unjust but savory vengeance).

Surprisingly, or rather not, distributed ledgers can be a powerful ally to that end.

## DLT genesis: Economy and Finance

![Bitcoin](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-blockchain-technology-bitcoin252622.jpg)

Arguably the first distributed ledger system appeared in 2009 with the publication of ["Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), a white paper signed by a still unknown individual or collective under the now legendary pseudonym of _Satoshi Nakamoto_ (although it seems like the [NSA figured out something](https://medium.com/cryptomuse/how-the-nsa-caught-satoshi-nakamoto-868affcef595) through [Stylometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry)).

[**Bitcoin**](https://bitcoin.org) is still probably **the** most famous and recognised **single-purpose, public distributed ledger** implementing a **totally decentralized form of digital cash with no intermediaries at all** and it is built upon a _blockchain_ structure; the brilliant idea of Bitcoin's author(s) lies not so much in novel discoveries but rather in an original and organic way of integrating previous research results with economic incentives into a fully functional concept.

As in all public ledgers, Bitcoin users don't need to be authenticated into the system but can join and leave as they please: the only requirement is using a standard-compliant address. For this reason Bitcoin and other public ledgers need to be resilient against _identity forgery_ (AKA _Sybil_) attacks, where a minority of nodes tricks the system into considering it a majority through massive address forgery.

To cope with such attacks, public ledgers need to use a consensus scheme that makes it impossible for a minority to be "stronger" than the majority. Bitcoin's slogan "one CPU, one vote" refers to **Proof of Work**, a competition (or rather a lottery) of computationally difficult (but easy to verify) cryptographic puzzles that must be solved in order to acquire the right to cryptographically "seal" a new block of transactions into the ledger: proof of work forces an attacker, in order to be successful, to possess the _majority of computational power_ rather than just the majority of addresses. This process is also called _mining_ because it also mints new currency that the winning "miner" can legitimately claim according to the Bitcoin protocol (in addition to transaction fees).

A single Bitcoin, even though the system suffers from serious price volatility problems and massive energy waste due to Proof of Work, is nowadays worth more than three thousand U.S. dollars.

Less wasteful alternatives to Proof of Work for consensus in public blockchains are being investigated, such as [Proof of Stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) based of staking a digital currency wealth portion, [Proof of Elapsed Time](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-elapsed-time-cryptocurrency.asp) based on trusted hardware certifying a random interval of time elapsed, and [Proof of Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-authority) based on _identity at stake_, i.e. pre-authorized validators that stake their reputation (for a more complete list of consensus algorithms, have a look at [this impressive round-up by Vaibhav Saini](https://hackernoon.com/consensuspedia-an-encyclopedia-of-29-consensus-algorithms-e9c4b4b7d08f)).

A full-blown (high-risk) **crypto-exchange market** has flourished since Bitcoin's inception due the proliferation of more or less interesting (and more or less hyped) digital denominations.

Bitcoin's ledger is totally public so, even though it might not be easy to find out who the owner of a Bitcoin address is, every Bitcoin transaction is out in the open and includes the addresses of a transaction's parties, when they transacted, how and and how much. [**zCash**](https://z.cash/), in contrast, employs a recently discovered cryptographic technique called [_zkSNARKs_](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/) that makes [Zero-Knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) non-interactive (i.e. single-payload) and succinct enough to allow verification and re-verification of program logic (in zCash's case, validating a transaction) without disclosing any information at all about it.

[**Ethereum**](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper), on other other hand, is probably today's most famous _general purpose_ public distributed ledger: like Bitcoin it implements an internal digital currency, "ether", but in addition it supports **Smart Contracts**, that is transactions supporting not just transfer of [fungible value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility) but any arbitrary code execution and state storage, for example any sort of financial (and not) contract including multi-stage agreements, multi-signature escrows, crowd-funding etc. Language implementors can support Ethereum by compiling programs into _bytecode_ that is run in a deterministic (to make transaction re-verification possible), sand-boxed runtime environment: the _Ethereum Virtual Machine_ or EVM.

Ethereum also uses Proof of Work for consensus (and so it is a blockchain that can be _mined_) but it introduces a memory-intensive one to replace the CPU-bound algorithm adopted by Bitcoin, so that specialized hardware can't have a real edge against a general-purpose computing equipment. This is important to reduce the risk of the majority of computing power concentrating in the hands of few.

Interestingly Ethereum also significantly differs from Bitcoin as far as the **data model** is concerned: Ethereum thinks of the blockchain state rather traditionally, at least at a logical level, as the "current situation" of both ether accounts (i.e. their "balance sheet") and contracts state; Bitcoin instead sees it as **UTXO**s, or _Unspent Transaction Outputs_, that is "nuggets" of state (in Bitcoin's case, currency denominations), each identified by an universal ID, that can get "consumed" (and so invalidated) by transactions to produce new valid ones.

The peer-to-peer model with built-in trust offered by distributed ledgers not only suits the anarchist economic revolutions of public digital ledgers but also, on the other extreme of the spectrum, traditional financial organizations that trade and compete in the market and trust each other only partially (if at all); distributed ledgers allow them to safely associate and cooperate in **consortium ledgers** with the important difference that in their case the participants needs to be _authenticated_ and so the ledger needs to be "**permissioned**". Note that permissioned ledgers are not susceptible to Sybil attacks because identities cannot be forged, so typically they don't need to use expensive and slow consensus protocols such as Proof of Work and adopt instead much more lightweight ones such as [Raft](http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/) or some incarnation of [Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)](https://medium.com/loom-network/understanding-blockchain-fundamentals-part-1-byzantine-fault-tolerance-245f46fe8419).

[Access management in a permissioned ledger is itself an interesting challenge](https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/identity-management-for-secure-permissioned-blockchains/) as allowed participants (and/or identities) are expected to change dynamically, for example as result of organisational churn, credentials expiry or a same participant acting in different roles ("multiple hats") depending on the context. Distributed ledgers can themselves offer interesting solutions to identity management such as self-sovereign identities like [Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/)'s, [Uport](https://www.uport.me/)'s and [Nuggets](https://nuggets.life/)' or decentralized trusted identities based on real IDs such as [ShoCard](https://shocard.com/)'s.

Being heavily based on public key cryptography, identity management in the distributed ledger world also needs to innovate in cryptographic (private) keys protection and storage without compromising ease-of-use and the final user experience, an example being [Safekee](https://safekee.io/)'s decentralized cold storage from Lugano-based [Swiss Blockchain Technology](https://swiss-blockchain-technology.ch/). 

I am aware of three major ecosystems for Enterprise (i.e. permissioned) Distributed Ledgers, two out of the three especially oriented towards the finance world: Bitcoin-inspired [R3](https://www.r3.com/)'s [**Corda**](https://www.corda.net/), [J.P. Morgan-Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/)'s [**Quorum**](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum) based upon Ethereum and the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/) specifications and [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org)'s [**Hyperledger**](https://www.hyperledger.org/) ecosystem of Open-Source projects.

[**Corda**](https://docs.corda.net/_static/corda-introductory-whitepaper.pdf) uses a "state nuggets consumption" data model analogue to Bitcoin's but it is permissioned, general-purpose and does not adopt a blockchain structure but it's rather based on a point-to-point communication system: Corda does not store transactions and state in a replicated ledger acting as a "single source of truth" but rather only the involved parties and optional, contract-validating _notaries_ know of (and verify) transactions and associated state transitions; this also implies that _the whole state transition chain must be retrieved and verified for a transaction to be considered valid_. Consensus and "unspent" validation are optionally provided, with or without contract logic validation, by _notary services_ published in the network. Corda's smart contracts take the form of functions restricting and validating specific state transitions, rather than general programs with persistent state (as in Ethereum); they are written in [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/), run on a deterministic [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) sandbox and supports long-running, potentially interactive _flows_ with automatic persistence and resume by serializing lightweight threads via Parallel Universe's [Quasar](http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/). Corda also includes an extensive library of state types and libraries to develop financial applications.

One of [**Quorum**](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum)'s core goals is to reuse as much as possible the existing codebase of [`geth`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth), Ethereum's protocol implementation (node) written in the [Go](https://golang.org/) language, as well as easily incorporate back its future developments. As such, Quorum aims to adhere to the [Enterprise Ethereum specification](https://entethalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/EEA_Enterprise_Ethereum_Client_Specification_V2.pdf) and is essentially a permissioned and privacy-augmented version of Ethereum, it is compatible with the Ethereum protocol itself (it just adds a privacy layer on top of it), its contracts are written in [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) and run on the [EVM](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) just like Ethereum's. Being permissioned, Quorum does not need Proof-of-Work but leverages `geth`' support for pluggable consensus algorithms and supports instead [Raft](http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/) and [Istanbul BFT](https://es.slideshare.net/YuTeLin1/istanbul-bft) out-of-the-box. Quorum's privacy features include specifying transactions and contracts as private to a set of parties as well as a very interesting proof of concept of [_z-contracts_](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/zsl-q/blob/master/docs/ZSL-Quorum-POC_TDD_v1.3pub.pdf), i.e. contracts for exchange of fungible assets made private through ZSL (the zCash protocol based on the ground-breaking zkSNARKs technology).

[**Hyperledger**](https://www.hyperledger.org/) is a Linux Foundation-managed incubator and umbrella of Open-Source blockchain technologies and distributed ledger implementations geared towards enterprise usage. The most mature project is [Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) which, together with the [Composer](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/composer) development and collaboration environment, aims to provide a modular foundation for business distributed ledger projects in general.

As you can see, the financial world is actually the cradle of distributed ledger technology and many solutions have been used for quite some time now.

### DLT for Financial Trust, Disintermediation and Fees Reduction

Back to our personal finance real-life case, it could be re-imagined with the support of DLT as follows:

- You receive payments in government-backed crypto-currency without any intermediaries, directly through regular ledger transactions to your ledger account, which you can open autonomously;
- Similarly, you activate (through biometric recognition) payments from your mobile by using a crypto-wallet;
- Automatic payment of utilities are governed by smart contracts scheduled on your terms and they are also connected to smart sensors that check the quality and quantity: if the smart contract detects a contract infringement it suspend payments;
- Similarly smart contracts govern financial instruments owned by you and keep your investments safe from mistakes and frauds;
- Everything is safely and automatically notarized on the ledger;
- Fees are minimal as the system is secure by design and fully automatic;
- There are no branches, you do everything online from your phone, in fact there is even no bank;
- Your historical records, your balance and the state of your financial instruments (managed by smart contracts) are safe and sound (and private if you so wish) in the ledger and you can query them whenever you want; nobody is ever going to be able to alter them or to bring down the ledger due to its intrinsic decentralization and security properties.

There is really no limit to the automation (or interaction, for that matter) amount that you might conceive, for example if you're a very smart financial AI programmer you could code your own totally autonomous, super-intelligent personal finance manager smart contract (or buy access to one) to transact on the blockchain on your behalf.

## DLT for Security, Interoperability, Automatic Contracts Enforcement and Full Notarized Tracking in the Supply Chain

![Supply Chain](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-web-analytics-concept---multicolor-version181081.jpg)

You go to the supermarket or you order from home and pay in digital currency (see previous section) but before you pay you query the ledger for the (authenticated and signed) [supply chain records of your bananas](https://medium.com/@KodiakRating/the-journey-of-one-banana-a-supply-chain-in-motion-b82e53fe6816) and you find out that:

- They come from a specific plant in Ecuador and were picked at a specific day;
- They were washed, sorted and packaged the day after at another specific plant nearby and the (signed) quality inspection placed them in first quality;
- They were stored and kept refrigerated at an average temperature always within limits as signed by multiple sensors, so they stayed in the higher price range;
- They were brought to the haven by a specific company on a specific date and the travel took 9 hours in a refrigerated truck, also always within limits;
- The sea shipment to the national port took some time and the temperature rose slightly above the contractual limits for a short time, as signed on the ledger by the ship's cell sensors, so the fruit, as per contract, became classified as very good but not excellent and the shipper will get paid (in digital currency) slightly less as per agreements; the GPS sensors alerted the transporter that reached the cargo, as agreed, within an hour;
- The bananas arrived on your supermarket shelves yesterday after having been another day at the regional dispatch hub, always in correct conditions.

Using a distributed ledger means that all of the actors can collaborate on trusted records; contract compliance can even be enforced without disputes after the fact if contracts are implemented as smart contract code and IoT sensors are used to collect the needed information. The full supply chain trace can also be analyzed to improve both the individual steps and overall integration and cooperation.

For you, the consumer, it means **full and reliable traceability of all the steps**, no matter which or how many actors were involved, as well as cheaper products due to more efficient (thanks to automation) and less wasteful supply chains processes that are also (hopefully) more environment-friendly.

Finally, if you consider the vastly increased awareness that this transparency can bring, it could even become much easier for people to understand and self-educate about the environmental and social impact of their purchase habits.

As for the **energy market**, [Grid+ Energy from Consensys](https://www.ccn.com/consensys-has-begun-supplying-electricity-using-ethereum-to-texas) couples micro-payments powered by digital currency with smart contracts to bypass retailers and programmatically buy (and sell) electricity in a way that optimizes costs based on an analysis of your consumption profile (and of up-to-date information about the ever-changing free energy market prices). This is even more useful and effective when coupled with an energy storage solution (so that energy can be purchased when it's cheaper and stored for later usage), with energy generation facilities such as photovoltaic solar panels (so that you can sell back to the grid for a revenue) and in the renewable energy market where energy sources are intermittent, energy is more difficult to store and distribute effectively and, for that reason, it also tends to have greater price fluctuations.

## DLT for Decentralized Trusted Identity, Personal Information Management and the Public Administration

![Blockchain IDM](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-online-security-concept---fingerprint174328.jpg)

Now I want you to bear with me through an imagination exercise, the "**Expat Dream**":

- Your ID is digital and secured by your government's ledger.
- You interview at a company in a destination country and provide authorisation for them to access the (authenticated on-ledger) instruction and work credentials associated with your ID; everything turns out fine, both you and you future employer are excited and you agree on an contract (signed on-ledger) conditional on the fact that you can get your pre-authorization to move there. 
- A decentralized application already knows what needs to be asked for a move to another country and asks you for authorization about providing the needed personal information associated with your ID as well as your authorisation to obtain the needed documents (and to pay in digital currency for them); when you confirm with a biometric access from your phone, your [DApp](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/383/what-is-a-dapp)'s smart contract interacts appropriately with "officer" smart contracts of all the relevant administrations to obtain all the required entitlements and documents, which hopefully you'll have in minutes or maybe hours (let's say even a couple of days if manual steps need to be taken in back-offices). International documents are obtained automatically as well, by your government's smart contracts, through interactions on the international ledger with the destination country's ones and you authorize them to access your work proposal as well; everything is compliant so your moving request is registered and is automatically pre-authorized.
- If you so allow, the destination country's smart contract for pre-authorization could automatically unlock your employer's contract, or you could do so yourself through the DApp.
- You secure a rental contract by using another DApp that obtains your authorization to provide personal details and the needed assurances, for example the pre-authorization to travel to the destination country and a digital currency escrow for the first few months; this process can be fully automated too and the choice of the place on your behalf, based on trusted, certified and ledger-sealed information about the flat, could be the only interaction you need.
- You similarly allow access to the needed health records and buy an accredited health insurance as well as tickets, all performed at low fees in digital currency and duly notarized in the currency's ledger; everything you'll buy anywhere will be also safely notarized and you'll be able to access the entire supply-chain trace of anything you buy if you so wish (or let a program carry out some basic checks of quality and fitness for you).
- Once at destination you'll authorize access to your national ID, a destination country record representing your visa will be added to the destination country's ledger and smart contracts will link your national ID and the newly created visa in the international ledger.
- Your newly created position in the destination country will also unlock: the visa renewal smart contract will be scheduled and you'll obtain the entitlement to convert your driving license, to buy a health insurance, to obtain a (limited) current account and the final authorization for the employment relationship to start.
- Provided you release the needed information and you behave properly, you might have no need to go to any branch for interviews, rather the visa will be renewed automatically at the next expiry and will be digitally available to you instantly.
- Transactions of the international ledger (for example, an OECD one or an EU one) can of course be dependent on national policies and international agreements, either automatically (if coded as smart contracts) or assisted by officers.

That's right: zero bureaucracy, just a few biometric authorizations on your phone. No travels, no wait times, no human errors, no arbitrary behaviors and decisions of not-so-well-meaning offices, no extra costs, no nerves and much lower administrative costs due to a greatly increased efficiency.

Of course the whole process would be traceable and you can figure out what went wrong (or right), when, where and why rather quickly while being sure everything is property authenticated and nothing has been tampered with.

If you think this is and will stay a dream for a long time, it's time to read about the [First official registration of a Zug citizen on Ethereum](https://medium.com/uport/first-official-registration-of-a-zug-citizen-on-ethereum-3554b5c2c238) through Zug's partnership with [uPort](https://www.uport.me/).

I think it's not coincidental that Switzerland, a country with a strong decentralization and direct democracy (and financial business) tradition, is home to a lot of distributed ledger initiatives and startups; also not so coincidental that they are mostly located in the Zürick and, well, _Zug_ areas, in what has been named the [Crypto Valley](https://cryptovalley.swiss/).

## DLT for Health Care

![Trust](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-stethoscope127462.jpg)

It has been written that [**Healthcase might be the ultimate Blockchain use case**](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-in-healthcare/) and that [Distributed Ledger Technology is perfect for Healthcare](https://medium.com/crypto-oracle/eleven-reasons-why-distributed-ledger-technology-is-perfect-for-healthcare-bc6adb02406f); indeed [projects from both start-ups and bigger enterprises](https://medicalfuturist.com/top-12-companies-bringing-blockchain-to-healthcare), such as London- and Lugano-based [MedicalChain](https://medicalchain.com)'s, aim to tap into the potential of Distributed Ledger Technology to bring down harmful data barriers between intermediaries in the medical and health care ecosystem, improve trusted cooperation between all actors, eliminate security issues affecting centralized databases (that nowadays hold extremely sensitive health and personal data) as well as returning control of medical records and history back into the hands of their rightful owners, that is _the patients_.

Distributed Ledger Technology allows the health care ecosystem to:

- Reduce or eliminate the need to resort to intermediaries and brokers;
- Create a secure, trusted, interoperable, privacy-abiding, permanent and authoritative digital deposit of medical records;
- Govern the use and disclosure of personal health information, even automatically so through smart contracts that encode obligations and best practices;
- Allow trusted cooperation between actors in the ecosystem that don't necessarily trust each other and that might have misaligned interests, such as health care professionals, hospitals, patients, regulators, pharmaceutical companies;
- Allow patients to govern access to their medical data;
- Allow non-sensitive information and transactions to be public, for example to publish authenticated price transparency and quality metrics data.

If we look back at our **medical appointment scenario** from this perspective:

- You have no card, your medical records and health insurance subscription are secured in the ledger, associated with your digital ID and governed by your cryptographic keys that are safely stored and that you can activate biometrically from your smartphone;
- You use a DApp from your phone (or PC) to setup an appointment with the clinic, authorizing access to only the strictly needed personal and insurance information, and you'll have access, if you so wish, to all of your doctor's authenticated credentials and identity information before confirming;
- You'll go to the clinic on the agreed date and time and will be granted access and directions automatically based on your digital ID and appointment data;
- Once in the doctor's room, she'll identify herself through her ID, if you so wish, so that you can verify it's the right person (for example if she prefers not making her picture public);
- Conversely you'll identify yourself and provide her access only to the strictly necessary personal, medical and insurance information, which you'll be able to review;
- After the medical examination, she will provide additional medical records which you'll review and authorize the ledger to store and connect to your digital ID;
- She will also attach prescriptions for needed drugs and examinations, governed by a smart contracts under certain terms;
- If it's ok with you, anonymous data that will help improve the health care system and general medical knowledge will be shared publicly after your review;
- You go to the drugstore or specialized clinic and obtain your treatments, authorizing payments in digital currency after having verified (if you so wish) the supply chain history;
- The health authority and/or the clinic might ask you for partial access to the new treatment record in order to double-check everything is appropriate (and/or for analytical purposes).

You do not need to trust any intermediaries at all and, should you wish to change clinic, you'll do so in a few clicks by opening a new position and authorizing access to (part of, if you so wish) your medical records; the account creation smart contract will also take care of closing any previous position associated with your ID on your behalf.

## DLT and Liquid Democracy

![Liquid Democracy](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-vote-key-shows-options-voting-or-choice228864.jpg)

[Liquid.US](https://liquid.us/) is one of the initiatives that hope to dramatically **improve political accountability and transparency, democratic participation and government trustworthiness, reliability and effectiveness**. [Liquid Democracy](https://medium.com/organizer-sandbox/liquid-democracy-true-democracy-for-the-21st-century-7c66f5e53b6f) is a political paradigm that allows _both_ direct democracy _and_ fine-grained, quickly reconfigurable single- or multi-level representative democracy down to the resolution of individual votes (or, perhaps more often, with a short-term delegation lease and differentiated by topic).

Distributed ledgers [are clearly an excellent tool](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/24/liquid-democracy-uses-blockchain/) to secure built-in accountability and transparency of all the votes as well as of the many such quickly-reconfigurable, fast-changing vote delegation relationships.

## DLT for the Real Estate Market

![Real Estate Blockchain](/images/why-dlt/stockvault-kaghan-valley112534.jpg)

Deloitte's ["Blockchain in commercial real estate"](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/blockchain-in-commercial-real-estate.html) report offers an analysis of why distributed ledgers can dramatically improve real estate processes and practices. As a matter of fact, some real estate properties have already been completed successfully across borders with the help of distributed ledger platforms, such as [this sale](https://www.verdict.co.uk/blockchain-real-estate/) completed in compliance with the European Union's articulate legal framework through [Propy](https://propy.com/).

Another interesting use case for distributed ledger technology is [real estate tokenization](https://medium.com/8-decimal-blog/the-tokenization-of-a-30-million-manhattan-real-estate-property-8a273407288c).

As for our **house purchase story**, let's re-imagine it with distributed ledger technology:

- Once you've chosen your future house, you can access the land register autonomously to check all the current and historical property's information and have it analyzed by a legal services provider;
- If everything is OK you can authorize the release of information (associated with your digital ID) needed to obtain a mortgage with the credit institution of your choice;
- An escrow smart contract will wait, within an agreed time frame, for your security deposit, the seller's security deposit, the legal analysis results and the mortgage sum;
- If the time frame expires, the escrow will pay the due penalties depending on who didn't act within the time frame and return the rest of the money;
- If everything is fine, the escrow will pay the agreed amount to the seller and will update all positions with new relevant records: yours, the sellers, the land register's, the bank's and even the legal services provider.

Congratulations! After a week has passed and a few authorizations have been granted from your phone, you're now the rightful owner (well, the credit institution really is, until you pay back the mortgage) of your new home.

# The challenges and shortcomings of DLT

Distributed ledgers are an **horizontal innovation**, similarly to the Internet, rather than a _vertical_ one: they provide a technological foundation that is domain-neutral and can be used in a variety of situations; this is a reasons why it can be hard to grasp, but also why it could have an application range limited by imagination and vision alone.

On the other hand it is certainly not a panacea and e.g. 2018's World Economic Forum's report ["Blockchain Beyond the Hype"](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/48423_Whether_Blockchain_WP.pdf) provides a decision chart helps understanding if and when distributed ledgers are really helpful; it is my hope that the notary analogy and the several prominent cases collected here will also prove useful.

It must also be stressed that, as any technology or scientific discovery (and especially those with a broad applicability range), **distributed ledgers are _ethically neutral_** and they can be used for good as well as less good purposes. Think for example of totally anonymous, decentralised, deregulated and authority-free digital currencies: the are the dream money circuit of illegal markets and criminal enterprises.

Another example of bad usage could be automation governed by **bad policies**: suppose that I get to unlock my car's door through a very simplistic smart contract that checks if my leasing and/or insurance payments are OK; suppose now that for some reason they are not but I need to urgently bring a family member to the hospital: smart contracts have no compassion nor they allow for mistakes, so humane policies, emergency bypass mechanisms, functioning social services and adequate regulation will be paramount.

In addition, while some players subscribe to the view that "the code _is_ the contract", I personally think this is a dangerous and dysfunctional proposition and I prefer to consider smart contracts as _implementations_ and _automation tools_ for agreements, rather than their authoritative source; for example, Corda supports _attaching authoritative contract prose_ to smart contract code so that disputes can easily refer to it.

I also think that supporting **smart contract upgrade** (e.g. to fix bugs) is a wise idea, especially considering that smart contracts are _very_ security-sensitive code that need accurate review before being activated; furthermore, programming smart contracts is fairly different from regular software development and is still a very young craft backed by not enough literature and research (even though [notable efforts exists](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/)).

The emergence of interoperability standards will also be essential to allow domains and business on different platforms (or even ledgers) to seamlessly work together without resorting to any kind of trusted bridge authorities, which bring centralisation and reliance on intermediaries back into the picture.

Finally, the technology itself is evolving at a very fast pace to cope with intrinsic challenges such as:

- [Scalability](https://hackernoon.com/blockchains-dont-scale-not-today-at-least-but-there-s-hope-2cb43946551a) versus resilience against errors and attacks versus decentralization.
- [Access and identity management](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/48423_Whether_Blockchain_WP.pdf).

These issues notwithstanding, the publication of Bitcoin's paper opened a Pandora's box of innovations (and hype) that, after ten years, is still stimulating debate and thrilling many circles because of its potential vast range of applicability; I believe that the best is yet to come and I hope this article will serve as an introduction to a very fascinating world with a solid potential to significantly change the IT industry and, more interestingly, society at large.
